#Rita's Dolls House

Rita's Dolls House is a domotic dolls house I've built for my daughter Rita.

House is 1.2m high and have 6 rooms. Every room has 4/5 leds on the ceiling.
At the centre of the house there is an elevator.
Elevator and illunination can be controlled via bluetooth from an android app.

Core is a PIC16F722 from microchip, programmed with XC8 C compiler and MPLAB X Ide.
Bluetooth communication is gained through a cheap HC-05 module
