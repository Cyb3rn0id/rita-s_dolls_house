# Rita's Dolls House

Rita's Dolls House is a domotic dolls house I've built for my pricess daughter Rita.  
House is about 1.2meters tall and has 6 rooms, it's entirely made of wood and recycled parts. Every room has 4 or 5 leds on the ceiling. At the centre of the house there is an elevator. Elevator movement and illumination can be controlled over Bluetooth from an android app I've built using [MIT App Inventor 2](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/). I presented this house at Maker Faire Rome 2016.

House controller is based on a [PIC16F722](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/pic16f722) from Microchip. The Microcontroller is programmed using [XC8 C compiler](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers) and [MPLAB X IDE](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide). Bluetooth communication is obtained through a cheap HC-05 module.
